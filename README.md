# Base64 File Encoder 
- created with Python and Tkinter GUI
- created apps for Windows (portable .exe file) and Linux OS (binary executable)
- can encode multiple files at once
- all file extensions are supported, but the focus is on Image and PDF files as they are set as default file types
- the encoded base64 string for each file is saved in a custom directory as .txt file with the original input file name
