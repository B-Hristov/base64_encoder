# Base64 File Encoder 
## Simple base64 file encoder, created with Python and Tkinter GUI. With this app you can encode multiple files at once.

- Can run on: **Windows** (portable EXE file) and **Linux** (binary executable).
- All file extensions are supported, but the focus is on the most common image file formats (PDF, JPG, PNG, SVG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, ICO)
- The encoded base64 string for each file is saved in a custom directory as .txt file with the original input file name.
