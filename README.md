# Base64 File Encoder 
## Simple base64 file encoder, created with Python and Tkinter GUI. With this app you can encode multiple files at once.

- Can run on: **Windows** (portable .exe file) and **Linux** (binary executable).
- All file extensions are supported, but the focus is on Image and PDF files.
- The encoded base64 string for each file is saved in a custom directory as .txt file with the original input file name.
